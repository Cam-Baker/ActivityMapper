"Mar 1, 2019, 4:07:38 PM",That‚Äôs easily the worst part of garmin -> Strava import. It dings me because my treadmill maxes at an hour so I have to reset it

"Aug 18, 2020, 7:22:30 PM",[strava://athletes/20161000/14]Bill Tomlinson yeah I‚Äôm coming back slowly. I was a bit reckless on a hilly run a couple weeks back. I think that + the mileage strained a ligament. Switching to a single as your sole on the water time but I bet it beats nothing
